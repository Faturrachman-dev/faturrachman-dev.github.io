**Detailed Analysis (Focus on top options):**

<details>
  <summary>Detailed Analysis: Option A: Single-page scrolling design with fixed header</summary>

  **Description:**
  A continuous single-page design where all sections (Home, About, Projects, Skills, Contact) flow vertically. The navigation remains fixed at the top, allowing users to jump to any section instantly. Smooth scrolling transitions create a polished experience, while the dark GitHub-inspired theme creates a professional tech aesthetic.

  **Pros:**
  - Pro 1: Intuitive navigation pattern familiar to most users
  - Pro 2: Creates a natural narrative flow from introduction to contact
  - Pro 3: Simplifies mobile adaptation with vertical scrolling
  - Pro 4: Allows for creative section transitions while maintaining usability
  - Pro 5: Excellent for showcasing projects in a sequential portfolio style

  **Cons:**
  - Con 1: Less distinction between different content areas
  - Con 2: Can feel lengthy if not well-segmented
  - Con 3: Requires careful performance optimization for longer pages

  **Implementation Complexity:** Medium
  The implementation is straightforward with HTML/CSS/JS. Key components include smooth scrolling navigation, fixed header with transparent/solid states, and responsive section layouts. Animation effects for section transitions will add polish without excessive complexity.

  **Resource Requirements:**
  Minimal JavaScript for smooth scrolling and navigation highlighting. Image optimization will be crucial for performance. No special libraries required beyond basic vanilla JS.

  **Risk Assessment:**
  Low risk option. The main consideration is ensuring performance remains optimal on mobile devices with potentially limited processing power.

  <summary>Detailed Analysis: Option C: Split-screen portfolio</summary>

  **Description:**
  A modern split-screen layout dividing the viewport into two main areas: a fixed sidebar/panel containing navigation and brief identity information on one side (approximately 30% width), and the main content area on the other side (approximately 70% width). As users navigate, only the content panel changes while the navigation remains constant.

  **Pros:**
  - Pro 1: Creates a striking visual impression with clear content separation
  - Pro 2: Navigation is always visible and accessible
  - Pro 3: Allows for creative transitions between content sections
  - Pro 4: Provides a distinct, modern design that stands out
  - Pro 5: Works well with the dark GitHub theme (navigation in primary dark, content with subtle contrast)

  **Cons:**
  - Con 1: More challenging to adapt to mobile (requires complete layout shift)
  - Con 2: Less space for content on smaller desktop screens
  - Con 3: Potential accessibility challenges if not implemented carefully
  - Con 4: May sacrifice some content space for the persistent sidebar

  **Implementation Complexity:** Moderate-High
  Requires more complex CSS for the split-view layout and careful consideration of responsive breakpoints. JavaScript will be needed for the content panel transitions and potentially for mobile adaptation.

  **Resource Requirements:**
  Custom JavaScript for panel transitions and responsive adaptation. Careful consideration needed for mobile layout transformation.

  **Risk Assessment:**
  Medium risk option. The main challenges are ensuring a seamless mobile experience and maintaining accessibility with the more complex layout structure.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ DECISION & RATIONALE
- **Selected Option:** Option A: Single-page scrolling design with fixed header
- **Rationale:** The single-page scrolling design offers the best balance of visual impact, usability, and implementation simplicity. It creates a natural narrative flow from introduction to contact information, which aligns well with the portfolio's purpose of telling Faturrachman's professional story. This design pattern is also highly adaptable to mobile devices, which is a key requirement. 

  The GitHub-inspired dark theme will be implemented with the primary background color (rgb(13,17,23)) for the main canvas, with purple accents (rgb(118,70,168)) for interactive elements and highlights. This maintains the desired aesthetic while ensuring good contrast for accessibility.

  While Option C (split-screen) offers a more unique visual approach, the challenges with mobile adaptation and potential space constraints make it less suitable for a content-rich portfolio. Option A provides a better foundation for showcasing projects and skills in a way that's both visually appealing and functionally effective.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES (for the selected option)
- **Layout Structure:**
  - Fixed header with navigation that changes opacity on scroll
  - Full-viewport hero section with name, title, and brief tagline
  - Section-based content areas with consistent padding and max-width (1200px)
  - Subtle section dividers using border colors from style guide (#30363d)
  - Footer with minimal contact information and social links

- **Navigation System:**
  - Fixed position at top with transparent background initially
  - Transitions to solid background (primary dark) when scrolling
  - Active section highlight using accent purple
  - Mobile: Collapsible hamburger menu with smooth animation

- **Color Implementation:**
  - Primary background: rgb(13,17,23) for main canvas
  - Section backgrounds: Subtle variations using rgba(13,17,23,0.8) to create depth
  - Accent elements: rgb(118,70,168) for buttons, highlights, and active states
  - Text: #ffffff for headings, #c9d1d9 for body text
  - Cards/containers: Slightly lighter background (#1c2128) with subtle border (#30363d)

- **Typography Implementation:**
  - System-ui for main text with fallback to sans-serif
  - Consider adding 'Inter' from Google Fonts for a more refined look
  - Use monospace fonts (Cascadia Code, Fira Code) for code snippets or technical sections
  - Implement the font size hierarchy exactly as specified in the style guide

- **Component Design:**
  - Project cards: Subtle background elevation (#1c2128), 8px rounded corners, with hover state
  - Buttons: Purple accent for primary actions, transparent with border for secondary
  - Skills visualization: Custom progress bars or tags with the accent color
  - Contact form: Clean inputs with subtle backgrounds and minimal borders

- **Animation & Transitions:**
  - Implement smooth scrolling between sections (0.3s ease-in-out)
  - Subtle fade-in animations for content as it enters viewport
  - Hover effects on interactive elements (0.2s transition)
  - Loading animations for any dynamic content

- **Responsive Considerations:**
  - Implement mobile-first approach
  - Stack elements vertically on mobile
  - Adjust typography scale slightly for smaller screens
  - Collapse navigation to hamburger menu below 992px
  - Ensure touch targets are minimum 44px √ó 44px on mobile

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Lazy load images and heavy content
  - Minimize CSS and JavaScript
  - Optimize and compress all images
  - Consider using modern image formats (WebP with fallbacks)
  - Implement critical CSS for above-the-fold content
