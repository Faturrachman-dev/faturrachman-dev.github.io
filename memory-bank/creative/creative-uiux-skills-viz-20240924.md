**Detailed Analysis (Focus on top options):**

<details>
  <summary>Detailed Analysis: Option A: Interactive skill bars with category tabs</summary>

  **Description:**
  A tabbed interface that organizes skills into logical categories (e.g., "Languages", "Frameworks", "Prompt Engineering", "Tools"). Each tab displays a set of skills with horizontal progress bars indicating proficiency level. The bars are animated on view (filling from left to right) to create visual interest. Each skill includes a name, possibly an icon, and a visual indication of proficiency through both the progress bar length and potentially a label (e.g., "Expert", "Advanced").

  **Pros:**
  - Pro 1: Clear and direct representation of skill proficiency
  - Pro 2: Organized categorization makes information easily scannable
  - Pro 3: Animation adds visual interest without sacrificing clarity
  - Pro 4: Familiar format that users intuitively understand
  - Pro 5: Scales well from desktop to mobile

  **Cons:**
  - Con 1: Can appear conventional/less creative than other options
  - Con 2: Limited space for detailed skill descriptions
  - Con 3: Quantifying skills with percentage bars can sometimes be subjective

  **Implementation Complexity:** Low-Moderate
  Requires basic tab interface JavaScript and CSS animations for progress bars. Responsive design is straightforward with this approach, and the component can easily adapt to different screen sizes.

  **Resource Requirements:**
  Minimal JavaScript for tab switching and animation. CSS for styling and transitions. Potentially some SVG or font icons for visual enhancement of skill categories.

  **Risk Assessment:**
  Low risk. The approach is well-established and straightforward to implement. The main consideration is ensuring the categorization of skills is logical and the proficiency levels are represented accurately.

  <summary>Detailed Analysis: Option C: Skill card grid with filterable categories</summary>

  **Description:**
  A grid layout of individual skill cards, each representing a specific skill or technology. Cards are visually styled to indicate proficiency level through color intensity, border treatment, or badge indicators. Above the grid is a filtering system allowing users to focus on specific categories (e.g., "All", "Languages", "Frameworks", "Prompt Engineering"). Each card contains the skill name, possibly an icon, and a visual indicator of proficiency level. Cards can be arranged by proficiency or alphabetically within each category.

  **Pros:**
  - Pro 1: Highly visual and scannable format
  - Pro 2: Filtering provides interactive exploration of skills
  - Pro 3: Card format allows for consistent sizing and layout
  - Pro 4: Excellent for showing a large number of discrete skills
  - Pro 5: Easily adaptable to mobile with responsive grid

  **Cons:**
  - Con 1: May require more vertical space than other options
  - Con 2: Interactive filtering adds implementation complexity
  - Con 3: Can become cluttered if too many skills are displayed

  **Implementation Complexity:** Moderate
  Requires JavaScript for category filtering and potentially for animation effects. Grid layout needs careful responsive design considerations, but modern CSS Grid makes this manageable.

  **Resource Requirements:**
  JavaScript for filtering functionality and possibly animation effects. CSS for card styling, grid layout, and responsive adjustments. Potentially icons or small images for skill representation.

  **Risk Assessment:**
  Medium-low risk. The card grid is a flexible approach that can accommodate various skill types and categories. The main challenge is ensuring the filtering mechanism is intuitive and the visual indicators of proficiency are clear.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ DECISION & RATIONALE
- **Selected Option:** Option A: Interactive skill bars with category tabs
- **Rationale:** The interactive skill bars with category tabs provide the best balance of visual clarity, information hierarchy, and implementation simplicity. This approach clearly communicates both skill categories and proficiency levels in a format that users intuitively understand.

  The design will maintain the GitHub-inspired dark theme with the primary background (#1c2128) for container elements and accent colors (rgb(118,70,168)) for highlighting and interactive elements. The tabs allow for logical organization of different skill sets (development vs. prompt engineering), making the information easily scannable for recruiters or potential clients.
  
  While Option B (radar chart) offers a more unique visual representation, it can be difficult to interpret and presents accessibility challenges. Option C (skill card grid) is also strong but requires more complex implementation and potentially more vertical space.
  
  Option A provides a clean, professional presentation that aligns well with the portfolio's GitHub-inspired aesthetic and offers the clearest communication of skill proficiency levels, which is a primary goal of this component.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES (for the selected option)
- **Component Structure:**
  - Container: Slightly elevated background (#1c2128), 8px rounded corners, subtle border (#30363d)
  - Tab Navigation: Horizontal tabs at top with clear active state using accent color
  - Category Organization: 
    - Development: Languages, Frameworks, Databases, Tools
    - Prompt Engineering: LLMs Used, Prompting Techniques, Use Cases
  - Individual Skill Item: Skill name, progress bar, optional proficiency label

- **Visual Design Elements:**
  - Container Background: #1c2128 (slightly lighter than main background)
  - Tab Active State: Bottom border or background using accent purple (rgb(118,70,168))
  - Tab Inactive State: Subtle, muted appearance with clear hover state
  - Progress Bars: 
    - Background: Dark gray (#30363d)
    - Fill: Gradient using accent color (rgb(118,70,168) to lighter purple)
    - Height: 10-12px with rounded corners
  - Typography:
    - Category Headers: H3 size (1.5rem), white (#ffffff)
    - Skill Names: Regular weight, secondary text color (#c9d1d9)
    - Proficiency Labels: Small size (0.875rem), subtle positioning

- **Interaction Details:**
  - Tab Switching: Smooth transition between categories (0.3s fade)
  - Progress Bar Animation: Animate width from 0% to skill level (0.8s with easing)
  - Animation Trigger: Animate when scrolled into view (IntersectionObserver)
  - Hover States: Subtle highlight effect on skill items
  - Tab Focus: Clear keyboard focus indicators for accessibility

- **Proficiency Visualization:**
  - Scale: 0-100% represented visually in bar width
  - Optional Labels: 
    - Beginner: 0-25%
    - Intermediate: 26-50%
    - Advanced: 51-75%
    - Expert: 76-100%
  - Visual Reinforcement: Color intensity increases with proficiency
  - Key Skills Emphasis: Slight visual distinction for core expertise areas

- **Responsive Behavior:**
  - Desktop (>992px): Horizontal tabs, multiple skills per row
  - Tablet (576px-992px): Horizontal tabs, fewer skills per row
  - Mobile (<576px): 
    - Consider vertical/dropdown tabs if horizontal space is limited
    - Stack skill bars vertically for clarity
    - Maintain progress bar proportions
  - Touch Targets: Ensure tabs have minimum 44px height for touch interaction

- **Performance Considerations:**
  - Use CSS transitions rather than JavaScript animations where possible
  - Implement staggered animations to improve perceived performance
  - Ensure smooth tab switching without layout shifts
  - Use will-change property judiciously for animations

- **Accessibility Enhancements:**
  - ARIA roles for tab interface (role="tablist", role="tab", role="tabpanel")
  - Keyboard navigation for tab switching
  - Sufficient color contrast for all text elements
  - Non-visual indication of skill levels (text or aria-label with percentage)
  - Ensure animations can be disabled via prefers-reduced-motion
