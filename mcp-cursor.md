### What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

MCP is an **open standard** introduced by **Anthropic** in November 2024 to standardize how AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), connect to external data sources and tools. It addresses the challenge of fragmented integrations by providing a universal protocol for AI assistants to access real-time data, execute actions, and maintain context across diverse systems.

#### Key Features of MCP:
1. **Standardized Communication**: MCP acts as a "universal adapter" (like USB-C for hardware) that allows AI applications to interact with external systems through a consistent interface, reducing the need for custom integrations for each tool or data source.[](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)[](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/ai/mcp-explained/)
2. **Client-Server Architecture**:
   - **MCP Host**: The AI application (e.g., Cursor AI IDE or Claude Desktop) that initiates requests.
   - **MCP Client**: An intermediary that manages connections between the host and MCP servers.
   - **MCP Server**: Lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities (e.g., accessing databases, APIs, or file systems) via standardized protocols.[](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/educatordeveloperblog/unleashing-the-power-of-model-context-protocol-mcp-a-game-changer-in-ai-integrat/4397564)[](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/ai/mcp-explained/)
3. **Transport Types**:
   - **Stdio**: For local communication, where the MCP server runs as an executable and communicates via standard input/output. Ideal for local development.[](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)
   - **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: For networked communication, allowing remote or distributed setups.[](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)
4. **Capabilities**:
   - **Tools**: Enable AI to execute actions (e.g., sending emails, querying databases, or automating browser tasks).
