**Portfolio Projects (Crucial Detail!):**
For *each* project you want to feature, provide:

* **Project Title:** CursorView: AI-Powered Chat Session Explorer
* **One-Liner Description:** An elegant web application for viewing, exporting, and analyzing your Cursor AI chat sessions, featuring integrated AI to optimize your coding workflow.
* **Detailed Description:**
  What was the problem/challenge?

  1. Developers using Cursor often need a more robust and visually intuitive way to browse and manage their extensive chat session histories than the native UI provides, facing limitations in search, organization, and overall user experience
  2. A significant challenge was the inability to comprehensively export Cursor chat sessions, particularly with the inclusion of detailed agent interactions like MCP calls and tool usage, which existing solutions didn't support or keep pace with.
  3. Developers struggled to extract actionable insights from their AI coding conversations, lacking tools to analyze prompt effectiveness, identify patterns in AI responses, or understand their own interaction preferences to optimize future AI collaboration.

  What was your solution?

  1. This project delivers **CursorView**, an elegant and intuitive web application that allows users to seamlessly browse, search, and manage all their Cursor AI chat sessions aggregated across multiple projects from a centralized interface.
  2. The detailed chat view meticulously presents each conversation with rich metadata, including session origin (database vector location), project context, timestamps, and crucially, a clear display of MCP interactions and agent tool calls, ensuring full conversational transparency.
  3. An integrated AI assistant analyzes chat content, providing users with valuable insights into their prompting techniques, AI response patterns, and personal interaction preferences, empowering them to optimize their future AI-assisted coding workflows.

  What was the outcome/impact?

  1. **Enhanced Developer Productivity**: Provides a significantly improved UX for reviewing past AI interactions, making it faster to find information and learn from previous sessions.
  2. **Complete Conversational Records**: Enables comprehensive export of chat sessions, including vital MCP and tool call data, for thorough offline analysis, documentation, or team sharing.
